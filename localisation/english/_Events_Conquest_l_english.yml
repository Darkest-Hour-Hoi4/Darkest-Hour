# German conquest of Warsaw
 Conquest_POL.1.t: "Warsaw has fallen!"
 Conquest_POL.1.d: "Following article 87 of the Treaty of Versailles, the Germans were forced to give up lands following the 17th degree latitude towards the creation of the Polish state. It seemed that the Poles had finally achieved their independence after German-Austrian-Russian split and 100 years of hard fighting. But seemingly over not more than 10 days the Polish state has come to a halt. We, at the World Herald, are disappointed to report the fall of Warsaw to the German armies. Despite incredible Polish resistance, the expected German blitzkrieg has crushed the Polish armies and conquered Warsaw. After massive aerial bombardments, German troops rushed into the city before being repulsed several times, the siege began. After almost 10% of the Polish civilian population sustained injury as did 25% of the city’s infrastructure, the garrison surrendered.After several fringe elements were dealt with in the city, the German flag flags high above the Presidential Palace and the Sejm, while German HRs draw up lines for the future of Poland. It is generally agreed upon that Poland will soon fall after this."
 
 Conquest_POL.1.A: "Poland has not yet fallen! We will fight!"
 Conquest_POL.1.B: "The treaty is being undone. Long live the Vaterland!"
 Conquest_POL.1.C: "Let us hope they abide to the terms of the treaty..."
 Conquest_POL.1.E: "We must rescue Poland, quickly!"
 Conquest_POL.1.f: "Germany continues down the path of war...let us hope this is not as bloody as the last one."
