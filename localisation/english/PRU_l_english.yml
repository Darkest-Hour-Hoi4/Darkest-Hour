 PRU_Ecuador_War.1.t: "La Guerra del 41"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.1.d: "Ecuador is kinda sussy"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.1.a: "Proceed."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.1.b: "This isn't worth a War."
 
 PRU_Ecuador_War.2.t: "Peruvian Forces Mobilize!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.2.d: "Peru kinda sus"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.2.a: "Muerte a Peru!"
 
 PRU_Ecuador_War.3.t: "War Breaks out between Peru and Ecuador!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.3.d: "[From.GetNewsIcon]Following a series of gunshots and patrol skirmishes on the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border, Peruvian troops marched onto Ecuadorian soil, officially launching the two countries into war.\n\nThe war follows years of border fighting between Peru and Ecuador over land from the Andes Mountain Range to the Maranon River since 1938. The two countries have been at odds since the fall of Gran Colombia in 1857, when the first Ecuadorian-Peruvian War broke out. Columbia, a neighbouring country, was also involved in the fighting, engaging Peru in 1932 over a different land dispute related to the Salomón-Lozano Treaty. Following the brief war, a new treaty, the 1934 Rio Protocol, was established to uphold the original Salomón-Lozano agreement. Columbia, for its part, acknowledged Peru's border ambitions. Ecuador, angered by the agreement, rejected the claims and maintained diplomatic relations with Peru. Both countries began establishing army formations and patrols near the border, and it appears that tensions have reached a breaking point.\n\nPeru's army is significantly larger than Ecuador's, and the war is expected to be won quickly."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.3.a: "We will crush them!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.3.b: "No Pasaran!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.3.c: "We have bigger things to worry about than a petty land dispute."

 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.t: "Peru Defeats Ecuador, Ceasefire Signed"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.d: "[From.GetNewsIcon]The Ecuadorian-Peruvian War has now officially ended, with Ecuador's President signing a ceasefire to maintain political stability as Peruvian troops advanced toward the capital..\n\nPeruvian manpower and technology far outnumber Ecuador's, with divisions that include Czech tanks, artillery, and air support. This enabled them to quickly cross the border and enter the province of El Oro. The Peruvian air force also carried out limited air raids on villages like Huaquillas, Machala, and Arenillas.\n\nAccording to the cease-fire, Peru will now occupy the entire province of El Oro, pushing back the original post-war borders completely. This occupation, however, is expected to be temporary, as both countries are scheduled to attend a border dispute peace conference in Brazil in the coming months, with diplomats from America, Chile, and Argentina serving as mediators. Hopefully, this will put an end to the border fiasco for good."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.a: "Viva Peru!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.b: "..."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.c: "As expected."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.6.e: "Another loss for Quito"

 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.t: "Ecuador Stunningly Defeats Peru, Ceasefire Signed"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.d: "[From.GetNewsIcon] In a military win for the ages, the Ecuadorian army has forced the Peruvian President into a ceasefire, officially ending the war between the two South American nations.\n\nEcuador's army, airforce, and technology were well known to be smaller and outdated than Peru's, but through successful military tactics, their troops were able to capture the cities of Tumbes, Itutu, and Piura. To maintain stability in Peru, the President caved and signed the cease-fire agreement. Ecuador is now set to occupy the province of Tumbes as well as a large portion of Loreto.\n\nThe occupation has already resulted in clashes between Peruvian and Ecuadorian troops, and it is largely temporary until official peace talks begin in Brazil in the coming months. Diplomats from the United States, Chile, and Argentina have already agreed to mediate the meeting. For the time being, it appears that the border conflict has been resolved once and for all."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.a: "How could this happen?"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.b: "Viva Ecuador!"
 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.c: "We could learn a thing or two from those Ecuadorians."
 PRU_Ecuador_War.9.e: "A suprising victory"
