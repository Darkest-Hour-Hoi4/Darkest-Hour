 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.t: "The Halhamiao Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.d: "A Mongolian cavalry unit ambushed a nearby Manchurian patrol stationed around the Khalkhin Temple yesterday morning. Several Japanese military advisors were overseeing the patrol setting up base along the lines when the ambush caught them off guard, killing the Manchurian soldiers near the cavalry force as well as several Japanese advisors and volunteers.\n\nThe Mongolian attack force was counter-attacked with a machine gun, resulting in severe casualties and injuries for the Mongolian cavalry unit. A few dozen Manchurian soldiers and Japanese volunteers were killed, along with one officer and a few commanders, while 23 to 40 Mongolian cavalry riders were killed, with many more injured from the estimated 90-man cavalry regiment."

 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.5.d.JAP: "Near the large rivers that form the border between Russia and Manchuria, some fishy activity has been sighted and reported. Soviet troops have been crossing the border, disrupting activities and sabotaging outposts for reasons we don't know yet. This shows that we need to amplify border security between us and them for the security of our nation.\n\nWe’ve been getting reports that have confirmed what we have feared all along: The insidious Bolsheviks are raiding us! They’ve been disrupting outposts, and exchanged plenty of fire between our troops! Our nation is being threatened by the spectre of a red bear looking to take our nation by storm and establish their puppet government on Japanese soil! For the empire, we should increase border security and if these Bolshevik dogs dare to attack us, we shall show them what the spirit of the samurai tastes like!\n\nBut for now, we’ll wait and see what will happen next."

They stand everything against what we stand for, and are an obstacle to achieving our vision of a glorious socialist future! Pre-emptive action must be taken to stop them dead in their tracks, and only then will our glorious union be free from the decadent ways of Japan. For now though, we should send some of our troops on the border to make sure they don’t topple us if that's their goal.\n\nBut for now, we’ll wait and see what will happen next."

According to reports, the bandits severely damaged Japanese railroads and successfully intercepted numerous small Japanese logistic columns.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be of great assistance to our frontline effort against Japanese forces. They cannot fight against our superior forces unless sufficient reinforcements arrive on time, and given their army's lack of supplies, we may be able to easily overrun them."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.t: "Japanese Resistance Crumbles"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.d: "Our attack was a huge success, and the Japanese are fleeing for the hills! Because of our well-planned assault on the unprepared Japanese forward positions, they had no idea we had launched a full-scale assault until our tanks had broken deep into their lines and their resistance had completely crumbled!\n\nThere are now only a few lingering resistances in the region, which we will eliminate as soon as possible. This will almost certainly teach the Japanese a lesson and bring them closer to the bargaining table."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.A: "A great victory for the Red Army!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.t: "Assault Stalls Out"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.d: "Our assault on the Japanese has been stuttering, as we have been unable to breach their defences quickly enough before they can react. Now that more Japanese troops have arrived, we must declare this assault a failure; continuing the assault would be a waste of military resources. We must assess the situation, reorganise our troops, and plan a new offensive at a later time.\n\nHopefully, our next assault will be more successful than this stalled assault."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.A: "The Japanese are better than we think..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.t: "Japanese Rout Our Forces"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.d: "The attack has gone horribly wrong, and our troops have been routed by the Japanese forces! Not only did the assault fail because we did not break the enemy line, but the Japanese also counterattacked, shattering our forward element, completely disorganising our forces! We are now reorganising our remaining forces in order to hopefully stabilise the front line on our fallback position. This is a total disgrace for our army!\n\nThe Japanese will pay the price for this affront against us!"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.A: "A shameful display!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.t: "Mongolian Battalion Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.d: "The promised Mongolian reinforcement forces have arrived safely, bringing with them a full battalion of cavalry to aid us in our fight against the Japanese forces. It isn't much, but Mongolian forces don't have much to spare for this conflict in any case. At the very least, the cavalry battalion would be useful in future battles if we needed reconnaissance on Japanese positions and information on local terrain suitability for our forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.A: "A great addition to our forces."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.t: "Mongolian Platoon Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.d: "The promised Mongolian forces have arrived, but their numbers appear to be greatly exaggerated: instead of a full battalion of men, only a platoon arrived at our position! This would be an awkward situation for both our diplomatic and military fronts, and the Mongolians would have to answer for it after the conflict was over. Still, this is better than nothing, and perhaps we can find a way to use them somehow in the future war effort against Japanese forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.A: "Damn it!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.t: "Mongolian Forces Desert"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.d: "We didn't expect much from the Mongolians, but this is a different story! Mongolian troops have deserted! The Mongolian forces' lack of discipline would be a major embarrassment for our diplomatic initiatives, as well as a minor setback to our overall war effort against the Japanese. To deal with the Japanese army, we will have to rely on our own forces. And filling the positions left vacant by the Mongolian army, the Japanese must be rejoicing at their temporary advantage..."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.A: "Cowards!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.t: "Successful Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.d: "Today, our tank offensive made incredible progress! They have broken the Japanese line and crumbled their resistance, and are now driving deep into their rear lines, which we will simply clear out with our infantry to destroy the remaining fractured Japanese resistance that did not retreat. When this has been done, we will have won the battle in this region, which is likely to help tip the conflict in our favour. With more victories like this in the future, the Japanese will be forced to negotiate very soon."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.A: "A great victory!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.t: "Ineffective Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.d: "Our tank offensive appears to be...unimpressive, to say the least. The assault has done significant damage to the Japanese, but has failed to break through the Japanese lines further. Without such a decisive victory, we will have to prolong the standoff and re-adjust our approach against the Japanese positions. Hopefully, our next offensives will be able to achieve a complete breakthrough against the Japanese forces and bring us victory in this minor conflict."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.A: "At least it wasn’t a bad attempt..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.t: "Harsh Freezes Out the Tanks"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.24.d: "We appear to have underestimated the climate in the far east; our tanks' lubricants and fuels are unprepared for the harsh weather and are now freezing. As a result, our tanks are now frozen in place before we have even begun preparing for an attack. We must cancel this operation, and we hope that our maintenance teams can salvage whatever is still reusable in these wreckages. Until further assistance arrives, we must hand over the initiative to the Japanese and wait for reinforcements."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.t: "Conflict at Lake Khasan"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.JAP: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Russians have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Russians built the Chinese Eastern Railway to help connect their far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is now safely under our control and that of our Manchurian government. As a result, we maintain a military presence in the region to ensure that the Soviets do not get any stupid ideas, though this has recently been reduced due to our war in China.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. One of their generals defected last month, providing valuable information about the state of their armed forces following the recent purges. Despite their nation's propaganda, the truth is that their army is weak, and now would be an excellent time to strike the Khasan region. After being asked to withdraw their forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, they refused and continued to reinforce the area.\n\nWe have now ordered a small number of Kwantung divisions to assault their positions in the hope of dealing a crushing blow to their evil Communist nation. With the Emperor's will on our side, we'll send those poor socialists fleeing for their lives! It's impossible that we'll lose to them..."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.011.d.SOV: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century, we and the Japanese have had an extremely low level of trust in each other, which has culminated in several incidents, most notably the Russo-Japanese War. The Chinese Eastern Railway was built by us Russians to help connect our far-eastern lands to China, and the southern branch, known as the South Manchuria Railway, is unfortunately under the control of the Japanese and their pesky Manchurian collaborators. As a result, we maintain a significant military presence in the region to ensure that our neighbours do not get any stupid ideas.\n\nToday, however, tensions between our two countries have reached a boiling point in the Khasan region. After we reinforced our border there with trenches and communication posts in response to a defection last month of one of our generals who gave the Japanese critical information about the state of our forces, they requested that we withdraw our forces from the hills west of Lake Khasan, which we, of course, refused.\n\nThis has resulted in a small number of Kwantung divisions assaulting our positions in the name of their pitiful empire. We are confident that our forces will chase the rabid imperialist dogs away, demonstrating the full might of the Red Army! If we were to lose, those in command would have some serious questions to answer..."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.1.d: "Catastrophe! Disaster! Our losses have accumulated to the point where we have been pushed out of the hills near Lake Khasan after days of hard fighting. According to reports from the area, our forces were quickly repulsed after charging enemy positions. The sight of their friends being blown up by gunfire caused panic, causing any stability our frontline had to quickly crumble. This enabled the enemy to launch a devastating counterattack, sweeping past our defensive positions before digging themselves in once more. We were unable to retake the land we had lost after our men were routed, and all of our other attacks were unsuccessful.\n\nThis is a colossal failure. While this was primarily fought over a small area of land, and we would not have gained much if we had won, it does highlight our weaknesses in the field. Furthermore, once news reaches our nation's major cities, public morale may be shaken. For the time being, we must bury our dead, rethink our military strategy, and perhaps even downplay the magnitude of our defeat here."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Close Defeat"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.d: "Unfortunately, we learned today that our soldiers were beaten at Lake Khasan. While our forces were not completely destroyed, we were forced to retreat after days of hard fighting. According to officers fighting, we were on the defensive for the majority of the time there, and while things appeared to be going our way at first, the tide began to turn slowly as the enemy began to bring in more firepower to support their units.\n\nThis had a significant impact on the engagement, as we found ourselves conceding more and more ground in the latter stages of the fighting, to the point where we could no longer contest control of the hills near Lake Khasan.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a disappointing outcome, but we must consider the positives. We were able to inflict significant casualties on the enemy, ensuring that they bled for every mile of land they took. Furthermore, the forces that survived have gained valuable combat experience, and we may see some new officers emerge from their ranks. For the time being, the defeat is bitter, but we will return stronger."
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.2.A: "We must learn from our mistakes immediately."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.t: "Lake Khasan Incident - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.3.d: "After days of bitter and bloody fighting with enemy forces at Lake Khasan, a ceasefire has been declared, as neither we nor our adversary has gained enough ground to push each other back. This is not the desired outcome, but we will take it over being beaten and forced to retreat. Both sides' carefully planned assaults and defensive manoeuvres frequently meant that, while our offensives frequently resulted in heavy casualties, our positions on the hills allowed us to mount strong defences against their attacks.\n\nBecause neither side could make a breakthrough, our officers reached an agreement with the enemy to call a ceasefire. We should be proud of ourselves for holding off the enemy, even if there isn't much to show for it, and it's almost certain that our adversary will spin this story in their favour. However, the high command stated that it was a good experience for our soldiers, so that is one positive from this skirmish."

 JAP_SOV_Khasan_Incident.4.d: "Good news has reached the capital today, as our forces defeated the enemy at Lake Khasan, albeit at a higher cost to our generals. The fighting was tough, and it appeared at first that we would not be able to breach the enemy lines, but with skillful assaults by our officers and some tactical blunders on the enemy's part, we were able to show great resilience and win the skirmish.\n\nThis is a good result, even though it took a lot of resources and men to achieve it. The enemy fought valiantly, but not effectively enough to halt our advance. The soldiers who fought there will have invaluable experience that they will use in future battles. We must now ensure that any errors in our planning are corrected. This is a victory, but we have paid dearly in blood."

After the enemy launched a disastrous attack against our brave soldiers, we displayed a dominant display of our armed forces, remaining on top throughout the entire skirmish. Their frontline collapsed due to a significant drop in morale, and our boys, fueled by victory, launched a counterattack that sent them fleeing to the hills with their tails between their legs! Our flag was planted on the hills surrounding Lake Khasan to demonstrate that we have complete control of the area.\n\nThis victory will be celebrated at home, which will undoubtedly boost public morale. The soldiers who fought there deserve a medal or two for their bravery, and the experience they gained will be extremely valuable to their army careers. This victory demonstrates that our doctrine is correct, and we will undoubtedly benefit from it in our propaganda efforts."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.011.d.JAP: "Since our invasion of Manchuria in 1931, we have eagerly been eyeing new territory, particularly in the Soviet Union, our northern neighbour. Because of this, we have engaged in numerous border skirmishes, with the battle at Lake Khasan being one of the more notable engagements with the Soviets. Now, we find ourselves at odds with them once more, this time near a town called Nomonhan and Khalkin Gol river, located within their ally Mongolia.\n\nWe have been fortifying the border there for some time with the help of the Kwantung Army, and it seems our efforts will have been worthwhile. A small Mongolian cavalry unit has been attacked by one of our Manchurian cavalry units, as they were clearly violating our borders, although the Mongolians say that they were merely letting their horses graze in the disputed area. That is clearly a bluff however, most likely to get a reaction from our troops. Well, they certainly have got a reaction, but one that will see them swiftly defeated and punished for their insolence!\n\nAll of this has led to a rapid build-up of forces from both sides in the area, and it seems that border conflict at Khalkin Gol is inevitable, with international observers stating that it could end up being a bloody stalemate. But, if one side does wins, they will certainly end up having much more influence over the area than the other."

Because of this, we have engaged in numerous border skirmishes, with the battle at Lake Khasan being one of the more notable engagements with the Japanese. Now, we find ourselves at odds with them once more, this time over the Khalkin Gol river located within our brave ally Mongolia.\n\nAlong with the Mongolian army, we have been keeping a close eye on Japanese movement on the border, and we have noticed an increase in their fortifications recently. To see how far the Japanese would be willing to go, a small unit of Mongolian cavalry was sent to let their horses graze in the disputed area. It seemed like a harmless activity, but they were savagely attacked by Manchurian cavalry. We managed to get a reaction from them, but it seems they a preparing themselves for something more than we were expecting.\n\nAll of this has led to a rapid build-up of forces from both sides in the area, and it seems that border conflict at Khalkin Gol is inevitable, with international observers stating that it could end up being a bloody stalemate.

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.1.d: "In a complete disaster of our planning and preparation, our forces have been resoundingly defeated by the enemy! Our foes utilised their air support much better than we anticipated and combined with the skilled use of tanks meant that our forces were overwhelmed, with morale quickly plummeting after a series of small, but significant defeats.\n\nDespite launching a counterattack to try and repel enemy forces, it was our troops who found themselves being repelled instead after failing to capture any points of strategic importance, leaving our flanks open for one final enemy attack, which knocked us out of the battle altogether.\n\nNot only is this a humiliating defeat for our armed forces, but we have also left equipment behind such as tanks and trucks, all of which can be used by the enemy to identify weak points in our designs, which will surely help them should they ever engage in combat with us again."

Despite putting up a strong fight against the enemy, and inflicting many losses on them, our troops have been unsuccessful in pushing back and securing victory. There were points in the battle when the fighting was going our way, but defeat came when the enemy launched an all or nothing assault against our lines, with the gamble paying off for them.\n\nWhile this is a sobering defeat, we must take pride in the fact that we managed to hold up the enemy advance for some time, prolonging the battle and increasing the casualties they took. Our forces that fought there have also gained good experience of fighting against a strong enemy, and some generals are already pointing out who might be the new commanders of the next generation. We have been knocked down for now, but we will rise once more."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.2.A: "An unfortunate set of circumstances."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Stalemate"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.d: "Today, a ceasefire has been declared between us and our enemy as fighting at Khalkin Gol has turned into nothing more than a bloody mess, with no side able to gain an advantage over the other. The battle has been moving back and forth for several days, with one side gaining ground, only to be pushed back by a counterattack by the other. There were times where it seemed like we were about to make a crucial breakthrough, although it never managed to amount to anything significant enough to turn the tide in our favour.\n\nWith the ceasefire now in place, we will be able to recover our wounded and our dead, as well as any equipment that can be used again or turned into scrap. We should also try to portray this as a victory to our public somehow, as we are sure the enemy will do the same thing as well. Considering the situation however, we have identified several weaknesses within our doctrines, so we must now focus on improving and refining our combat tactics."
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.3.A: "Mistakes were made, and lessons were learnt."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Pyrrhic Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.d: "We have been informed today by high command that we have managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat at Khalkin Gol after days of hard and bloody fighting. After sustaining heavy losses in the first phases of the battle, it seemed likely that we were going to be beaten. However, after a superb flanking manoeuvre by one of the commanders, we managed to take the enemy by surprise and cause disarray within their lines, and after that they could never recover.\n\nDespite the victory in battle however, it has come at a steep cost to our forces in the region. We lost large swathes of men in several failed offensives, alongside numerous amounts of tanks and planes. This shows that there are still various areas of our doctrine that we can improve on, and our generals are already identifying areas that require immediate attention. "
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.4.A: "It’s a win... just."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.5.t: "Battle of Khalkin Gol - Victory"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.5.d: "Much of the nation is in celebration today as news of our total victory at Khalkin Gol has spread far and wide. Throughout the entire time our forces were there, they never looked as if they were going to be defeated, showing how dominant our army can be. With our use of tanks and infantry, supported by planes from above, we crushed enemy resistance and broke through their lines, inflicting heavy casualties on them. As the flag of our glorious nation was lifted over the battlefield, we began to collect our fallen, who will surely be remembered for their part in this stunning triumph.\n\nPublic morale has already been boosted, and there are plenty of medals to hand out to every soldier who took part. High command has stated that the doctrine used will be improved upon even more to strengthen our armed forces even more. This day shall long be remembered in the history of our nation!"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.5.A: "A victory for the history books!"

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.6.t: "Japanese Victory at Khalkin Gol"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.6.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]International experts have been paying close attention to the Mongolian-Manchurian border in recent days, as heavy fighting between Soviet and Japanese forces has taken place near Khalkin Gol. Today, an official statement from the Empire of Japan has said that “Soviet forces have been repelled from rightful Japanese territory, and the interests of His Majesty Hirohito have been protected from the stain of Communism”. This battle marks a recent string of border skirmishes in the far east, many being both bloody and brutal.\n\nIt is reported that nearly 100,000 troops in total took part, with numerous amounts of tanks and planes to support waves of infantry battalions. Many outside observers questioned whether Japanese forces would be able to defeat the Soviet troops stationed in Mongolia, as the conflict with the Chinese still rages on with no signs of stopping. However, the Japanese have proved them wrong, and their generals are calling it a “stunning victory”, although some question if it was a crushing defeat of Soviet forces.\n\nThe Soviet Union is yet to speak, although it is thought that a blame game has begun on who is responsible for the defeat. Many are weary of the recent purges in the country, and no one wants to be on the wrong end of an apparently angry Stalin."

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.7.t: "Bloody Fighting at Khalkin Gol"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.7.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Reports from the Mongolian-Manchurian border today have painted a grim picture of the heavy fighting that has taken place at Khalkin Gol. Since the end of the battle, a ceasefire has been declared between the two sides after they both found themselves in a bitter stalemate where neither side could find a decisive breakthrough. While both sides a trying to paint the battle in their favour, international experts say, “it is clear that there is no victor”.\n\nBoth nations went into the battle looking to win and exert more influence over the area than the other, but the gamble hasn’t paid off for either side, with thousands dead for no reason, as well as large amounts of equipment destroyed, such as tanks and planes. The tide of the battle turned in favour of each side numerous times, although neither army could use the momentum to win.\n\nThe two nations will now have time to reflect on what can be considered a disappointing end for both sides. For Japan, they will be wanting to improve their tactics for their current war in China as quick as possible, while for the Soviet Union, they will still be learning of new ways to move forward after the purges that removed many of their top generals."\n\nThe future of the far east looks as uncertain as ever.

 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.8.t: "Soviet Victory at Khalkin Gol"
 JAP_SOV_Khalkin_Gol_Incident.8.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Throughout the years, Japan and Russia have always been at odds, despite the change of ideologies in these nations. Today, the Soviet Union can finally claim victory over the Empire of Japan, with one Soviet official saying that “when the full might of the workers unite, the evil power of imperialism will crumble under the hammer and sickle, as we have shown to the world”. The end of the conflict at Khalkin Gol draws the curtain on one of the bloodiest border skirmishes the two nations have engaged in.\n\nWith an estimated 100,000 troops taking part in the battle, international experts had correctly predicted it to be the largest battle fought between the Soviet Union and Japan, with tanks and planes being utilised by both sides, although it was the Soviets who did this more effectively. While many claim it was the sheer amount of Russian troops that helped them win, Soviet high command insists it was their “superior tactics and planning” that secured them success.\n\nNo word has been heard from any Japanese officials, and it seems that they are trying to forget about the whole ordeal already and re-focus their efforts on China. For the Soviet Union however, the propaganda machine is already whirring again, and they will make sure that the whole world knows of their success."
