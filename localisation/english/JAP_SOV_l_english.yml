 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.t: "The Halhamiao Incident"
 JAP_SOV_Border_Conflict.1.d: "A Mongolian cavalry unit ambushed a nearby Manchurian patrol stationed around the Khalkhin Temple yesterday morning. Several Japanese military advisors were overseeing the patrol setting up base along the lines when the ambush caught them off guard, killing the Manchurian soldiers near the cavalry force as well as several Japanese advisors and volunteers.\n\nThe Mongolian attack force was counter-attacked with a machine gun, resulting in severe casualties and injuries for the Mongolian cavalry unit. A few dozen Manchurian soldiers and Japanese volunteers were killed, along with one officer and a few commanders, while 23 to 40 Mongolian cavalry riders were killed, with many more injured from the estimated 90-man cavalry regiment."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.13.d: "With the equipment we provided them, it appears that the bandits were successful in sabotaging the Japanese war effort in the region. According to reports, the bandits severely damaged Japanese railroads and successfully intercepted numerous small Japanese logistic columns.\n\nThis will undoubtedly be of great assistance to our frontline effort against Japanese forces. They cannot fight against our superior forces unless sufficient reinforcements arrive on time, and given their army's lack of supplies, we may be able to easily overrun them."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.t: "Japanese Resistance Crumbles"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.d: "Our attack was a huge success, and the Japanese are fleeing for the hills! Because of our well-planned assault on the unprepared Japanese forward positions, they had no idea we had launched a full-scale assault until our tanks had broken deep into their lines and their resistance had completely crumbled!\n\nThere are now only a few lingering resistances in the region, which we will eliminate as soon as possible. This will almost certainly teach the Japanese a lesson and bring them closer to the bargaining table."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.16.A: "A great victory for the Red Army!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.t: "Assault Stalls Out"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.d: "Our assault on the Japanese has been stuttering, as we have been unable to breach their defences quickly enough before they can react. Now that more Japanese troops have arrived, we must declare this assault a failure; continuing the assault would be a waste of military resources. We must assess the situation, reorganise our troops, and plan a new offensive at a later time.\n\nHopefully, our next assault will be more successful than this stalled assault."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.17.A: "The Japanese are better than we think..."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.t: "Japanese Rout Our Forces"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.d: "The attack has gone horribly wrong, and our troops have been routed by the Japanese forces! Not only did the assault fail because we did not break the enemy line, but the Japanese also counterattacked, shattering our forward element, completely disorganising our forces! We are now reorganising our remaining forces in order to hopefully stabilise the front line on our fallback position. This is a total disgrace for our army!\n\nThe Japanese will pay the price for this affront against us!"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.18.A: "A shameful display!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.t: "Mongolian Battalion Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.d: "The promised Mongolian reinforcement forces have arrived safely, bringing with them a full battalion of cavalry to aid us in our fight against the Japanese forces. It isn't much, but Mongolian forces don't have much to spare for this conflict in any case. At the very least, the cavalry battalion would be useful in future battles if we needed reconnaissance on Japanese positions and information on local terrain suitability for our forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.19.A: "A great addition to our forces."

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.t: "Mongolian Platoon Arrives"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.d: "The promised Mongolian forces have arrived, but their numbers appear to be greatly exaggerated: instead of a full battalion of men, only a platoon arrived at our position! This would be an awkward situation for both our diplomatic and military fronts, and the Mongolians would have to answer for it after the conflict was over. Still, this is better than nothing, and perhaps we can find a way to use them somehow in the future war effort against Japanese forces."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.20.A: "Damn it!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.t: "Mongolian Forces Desert"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.d: "We didn't expect much from the Mongolians, but this is a different story! Mongolian troops have deserted! The Mongolian forces' lack of discipline would be a major embarrassment for our diplomatic initiatives, as well as a minor setback to our overall war effort against the Japanese. To deal with the Japanese army, we will have to rely on our own forces. And filling the positions left vacant by the Mongolian army, the Japanese must be rejoicing at their temporary advantage..."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.21.A: "Cowards!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.t: "Successful Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.d: "Today, our tank offensive made incredible progress! They have broken the Japanese line and crumbled their resistance, and are now driving deep into their rear lines, which we will simply clear out with our infantry to destroy the remaining fractured Japanese resistance that did not retreat. When this has been done, we will have won the battle in this region, which is likely to help tip the conflict in our favour. With more victories like this in the future, the Japanese will be forced to negotiate very soon."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.22.A: "A great victory!"

 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.t: "Ineffective Tank Offensive"
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.d: "Our tank offensive appears to be...unimpressive, to say the least. The assault has done significant damage to the Japanese, but has failed to break through the Japanese lines further. Without such a decisive victory, we will have to prolong the standoff and re-adjust our approach against the Japanese positions. Hopefully, our next offensives will be able to achieve a complete breakthrough against the Japanese forces and bring us victory in this minor conflict."
 JAP_SOV_Decisions_Events.23.A: "At least it wasn’t a bad attempt..."
