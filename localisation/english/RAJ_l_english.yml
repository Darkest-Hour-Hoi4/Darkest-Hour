 RAJ_Flavour.1.t: "The Bengal Famine"
 RAJ_Flavour.1.d: "[RAJ.GetNewsIcon]Tragedy has struck India, with the Bengal area experiencing its worst famine on record. The death toll is only mounting, with millions already dead.\n\nFamines are typically caused by wars and a lack of food supply, but Bengul's famine was caused by a combination of factors. For decades, Bengal's railroads and supply lines have been neglected, and several recent natural disasters, such as the Midnapore Cyclone, have destroyed critical infrastructure. It exacerbated the Japanese invasion of the East, weak harvests, skyrocketing food costs, and an unstable market.\n\nFood hoarding quickly became prevalent, and a food black market developed as a result of the dwindling supply. The British government's reaction to the problem has been controversial. Propaganda claiming there was no famine merely increased hoarding, and promised imports have not arrived.\n\nThe consequences have been disastrous. Millions of people have died as a result of malnutrition and disease, societal order has been disrupted, millions are homeless, and relief is predicted to be slow. However, because there was no single cause of the famine, it's difficult to estimate how much of it could have been avoided."
 RAJ_Flavour.1.A: "Truly awful."
