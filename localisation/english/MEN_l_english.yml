#  Mengkukuo Focuses
######################################################################
 MEN_Inner_Mongolian_Army: "Inner Mongolian Army"
 MEN_Inner_Mongolian_Army_desc: "Much like the rest of the armies in China, the inner Mongolian army is poorly equipped, out of manpower, and incapable of expansion. It’s army is mostly comprised of cavalry, infantry, and limited artillery, lacking the more modern weaponry that her adversaries have. If Mengkukuo ever had any vision of expansion, it must reform and modernize, or it will get eaten up by the major powers vying for Chinese influence."
 
 MEN_Cahar_Suiyan_Railroad: "Chahar-Suiyan Railroad"
 MEN_Cahar_Suiyan_Railroad_desc: "The 2 regions of our nation, Chahar and Suiyan, are lacking in terms of infrastructure. As such, transport between regions is difficult and can take long periods of time. A solution was proposed, the creation of a railway system between these 2 provinces. This will help facilitate trade between the regions, along with faster mobilization of our troops in the event of a war."

 MEN_Stay_with_the_Kuomintang: "Stay with the Kuomintang"
 MEN_Stay_with_the_Kuomintang_desc: "The Nationalists are the key to restoring China as a great power, one that will repel the aggressive Japanese advances, and eliminate the warlords who rule China. While we are at their crosshairs of annexation, staying within their sphere of influence allows us to be protected from the Japanese and the communists."
 
 MEN_On_Our_Own_Terms: "On Our Own Terms"
 MEN_On_Our_Own_Terms_desc: "Neither the Nationalists nor the Japanese can win their influence over us. We will and shall not become a lapdog for those 2 wretched factions. We must stand independent, forging our nation’s destiny on our own terms. No nation shall be given the right to exert influence over our foreign affairs, our politics, our economy, our people and nation as a whole. Our country’s strength lies within ourselves, not with others."
 
 MEN_Defect_to_the_Japanese: "Defect to the Japanese"
 MEN_Defect_to_the_Japanese_desc: "The Nationalists are a lost cause, rifled with corruption, incompetence, and under threat of a communist takeover. Given this, we must turn to the Japanese, whose puppet state is right at our border. It would be a wise decision to support the Japanese war machine, who has been steamrolling Asia for the past decade. If we don’t, we might share the same fate as the rest of Asia who defied them."
 
 MEN_Hire_Foreign_Military_Advisors: "Hire Foreign Military Advisors"
 MEN_Hire_Foreign_Military_Advisors_desc: "To revamp our nation’s army, we must consider hiring military advisors from various nations. They will be allowed to give recommendations to our government on military strategy, equipment designs, along with creating an efficient military administration. While patriots may argue that we’re signing away our military to foreign powers, it’s necessary to expand and modernize our dilapidated army."
 
 MEN_Purchase_Foreign_Equipment: "Purchase Foreign Equipment"
 MEN_Purchase_Foreign_Equipment_desc: "To not only alleviate our supply storage, but also acquire advanced technology, we should buy equipment from various nations, such as Japan or Germany. These nations have invested time and effort into perfecting their weaponry and as such, are reliable investments. Once we get our hands on it, we can reverse engineer them, emulating them into a version for mass production."
 
 MEN_Army_Recruitment_Campaign: "Army Recruitment Campaign"
 MEN_Army_Recruitment_Campaign_desc: "To end our manpower shortage, we must embark on an ambitious recruitment campaign. To do so, we will expand our conscription laws to encompass the vast majority of our population. Along with expanding conscription laws, we may provide incentives for personnel who stay in the armed forces even after their reserve training is over."
 
 MEN_Mongolian_General_Staff: "Mongolian General Staff"
 MEN_Mongolian_General_Staff_desc: "Planning, preparation, and leadership are needed in achieving victory in battle. As such, the creation of a General Staff is a necessity. This committee will include high ranking military officials and advisors, who will draft battle plans and troop orders, oversee logistics and supply production in the event of an offensive or defensive war. This is so that when war comes to our homeland, we are prepared to face the enemy."
 
 MEN_Kalgan_Central_Academy: "Kalgan Central Academy"
 MEN_Kalgan_Central_Academy_desc: "Our soldiers and officer core are inadequately educated regarding tactics, grand strategy, and the likes. As such, the creation of a military academy in the capital is essential in teaching the next generation of warriors tactics, strategies, and combat in the battlefield."
 
 MEN_Literacy_Programs: "Literacy Programs"
 MEN_Literacy_Programs_desc: "Our nation, along with the other states of China, have high illiteracy rates amongst our population. As such, modernization and advances in technology are slowed, even halted. If we intend on expansion and modernization, we must introduce literacy programs and introduce mandatory education amongst the populace."
 
 MEN_Resource_Excavation: "Increase Resource Production"
 MEN_Resource_Excavation_desc: "Beneath the land we step on, is thousands of natural resources that we desperately need. Yet, we idly leave it be while our country is forced to trade with other nations, hemorrhaging our government revenues. We should instead focus our efforts in extracting these minerals, so that our country will be less dependent to foreign nations who may seek to undermine us."
 
 MEN_End_the_Nomadic_Lifestyle: "End the Nomadic Lifestyle"
 MEN_End_the_Nomadic_Lifestyle_desc: " For centuries, we have blindly kept our nomadic lifestyle, which while useful before, is now obsolete in this day and age. We must end such barbaric, reactionary lifestyle, as we’ve suffered far too long just to cling on to some ancient way of living. If we finally let go of it, we can finally say hello to progress."
 
 MEN_Heavy_Industry_Revitalization: "Heavy Industry Revitalization"
 MEN_Heavy_Industry_Revitalization_desc: "Our military industry is nonexistent, to say the least. Our lack of investment into the military industry has led to underproduction in desperately needed equipment such as guns. Due to this, our troops often bring nothing with them to battle, making them easy targets. Unless we intend to be free territory, we must invest significant amounts of our resources into weapons production, so that we can finally reverse our supply backlog once and for all."
 
 MEN_Stick_with_Traditionalism: "Revitalized Traditionalism"
 MEN_Stick_with_Traditionalism_desc: "While our norms and traditions are flawed, outright abolishing it from our society is not the correct answer. There’s a reason why it has allowed us to survive the tests of time, regardless of the circumstances. We must promote a renewed form of democratic traditions, one adapted to our current age. Reformation, not abolition, is the answer to our culture."
 
 MEN_Industrialization_Programs: "Industrialization Programs"
 MEN_Industrialization_Programs_desc: "The KMT have various business cliques within their borders, each of them controlling vast amounts of economic resources, such as heavy industry. If we can woo these powerful business cliques to invest in our economy, they can augment our industrial capacity, allowing us to produce more war material, or manufacture consumer goods."
 
 MEN_Keep_the_Council: "Keep the Council"
 MEN_Keep_the_Council_desc: "The council, while undemocratic, is still the better alternative in leading our nation than other alternatives. The council gives a sense of stability and allows efficiency in creating laws that govern our society. While some say our system is archaic and relics of a bygone era, it has nonetheless worked flawlessly."
 
 MEN_Cavalry_Training_Programs: "Cavalry Training Programs"
 MEN_Cavalry_Training_Programs_desc: "Our nation’s geography is filled with deserts and inadequate infrastructure. Given these 2 disadvantages, we must turn to the cavalry, infantrymen utilizing horses as means of transport. Cheap, efficient, and highly mobile, these cavalry units, if used tactically, can halt even an entire armor division. Given this, we must create a specialized cavalry training program or CTP, to train and help our units master the art of cavalry warfare."
 
 MEN_Autonomous_Federation: "Autonomous Federation"
 MEN_Autonomous_Federation_desc: "Centralization of our government can lead to inefficiency and disunity amongst the populace. As such, the government will switch to an autonomous federation. In this system, regions or provinces will be considered a political entity. This political entity will be given freedom to implement its own laws relative to the province, such as taxation, regulations, law enforcement, and other aspects. By decentralizing our government into small political entities, we can focus our efforts in more pressing matters."
 
 MEN_Invest_in_Agricultural_Production: "Invest in Agricultural Production"
 MEN_Invest_in_Agricultural_Production_desc: "Agriculture is the lifeblood of any nation’s economy. It’s also synonymous with national security, as without agriculture, we’re left with no choice but to import our food from our neighbors, giving them an excellent bargaining chip. We must invest in agricultural production, by incorporating new technologies, implementing agrarian reform throughout our arable land, all of which will ensure food security throughout the nation."
 
 MEN_State_Founding_Conference: "State Founding Conference"
 MEN_State_Founding_Conference_desc: "The Japanese have noticed inherent flaws in our governance system in terms of military, administrative, bureaucracy, and many other fields. To resolve these issues, a round table conference has been proposed by the Japanese. This conference is a meeting between Japanese and Mengkukuo officials, upon which they will create a new government that is in line with Japanese values and politics, but in consideration of the ethnic Mongols in the region. This will help create a government loyal to Tokyo that is accepted by the Mongol people."
