GER_SA.1.t: "Hunt for Göring, Bormann, Hess, Himmler and Heydrich"
GER_SA.1.d: "The new Reich is as unstable as ever, and our new dream of true National Socialism cannot be achieved if traitors hinder our progress constantly. All enemies of the National Socialist revolution must be dealt with. Those who once patriotically yelled “Heil Hitler!” are already dead men. The SA was instructed to target three special rivals: Hermann Göring, Hitler's dear friend, a veteran of the Great War, and the head of the Luftwaffe. Martin Bormann, a leading Nazi Party official, and previously Adolf Hitler's private secretary. And Rudolf Hess, another veteran and the man appointed 'Deputy Führer' to Hitler. \n\nIn a rapid strike by paramilitary SA forces, we managed to break into all their houses. Their resistance was dogged, but no much for the loyalty of our men. While attacking Göring, the old soldier refused to give in without a brawl. With a few handpicked bodyguards, he was able to hold off our efforts temporarily with machine-gun fire. Ammunition wouldn't allow him to keep it up. Meanwhile, Bormann was caught off guard busy in his bedroom and after a quick wrestle, the naked man was choked to death. Hess gave trouble too because a friend of his in the SA tipped him off. He attempted to enter a stolen fighter plane in his backyard, but Hess's pilot arrested him at gunpoint to save his own skin. \n\nThe threat of Göring and Hess, who were arrested alive but beaten, has been disposed of. Permanently. And all ten of Hess's associates in the SA have been executed to ensure nothing like this happens again. Though we may need to proceed with a few more attacks, the swift silencing of Göring, Borman, and Hess has shown the sheer power and will of the SA. There will be no mercy to traitors!"
GER_SA.1.A: "Five traitors dead, five steps closer to a pure Reich!"

GER_SA.2.t: "Death of Hjalmar Schacht"
GER_SA.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]He could barely register anything, as again the men hoisted him up the tree, the noose around his neck tightening with every pull until either his legs gave up under him or he slipped into unconsciousness, only to be woken up by either the kicks or the violent yanking of the SA men, who tried to get him to his feet so that they could read their mock sentence to him. Several times they tried to have him stand with his own power, but soon it became apparent that the first beating had been already enough to scar the former minister for the rather short rest of his life. In the end, they had to be content with pushing him down onto his knees and vaguely pulling his head towards the man standing in front of him.\n\n\"By order of the Stabschef of the SA, Ernst Röhm, I, Lennart Lummer, Rottenführer of the SA, sentence you to death for your crimes against the German people, the SA and the nation of Germany as a whole. The sentence will be fulfilled by hanging. Or torture.\"\n\nDesperately he hoped that they would choose the first option and finally be done with him, but alas the hard punch in his liver showed that they chose the way of the SA. Still reeling on the floor, gasping for air, they offered no time to recover and further subjected him to kicks, punches, and cuts, until he was no longer able to feel the individual wounds only a wave of pain engulfing his entire body. He tried to fight back, but nothing he could do now would save his life, only the slim chance that the pain would stop soon was worth fighting for.\n\nAnd so in the last calculated move of his life, Hjalmar Schacht, the former economic minister of Germany, a civilized man by all means, bit down hard on the hand that was close to his face. \"Ahh, the cunt bit me!\" \"Are you okay, Johann?\" \"No, I'm not! Damn, I think I need stitches. Goddammit, it fucking hurts.\" \"Calm down, we will go to the hospital soon enough, we need to take care of this traitor here first. Okay Gerd, get him on his knees. We do it my way.\""
GER_SA.2.A: "“Get the hammer.”"

GER_SA.3.t: "Meeting of Röhm and Gregor Strasser"
GER_SA.3.d: "Not long ago, Ernst Röhm and his Sturmabteilung’s “second revolution” triumphed over its enemies, and put the SA boss in a position of power in Germany and almost immediately, a search was started to find a new NSDAP Party Secretary. Röhm wanted his secretary to make up for his own shortcomings, so he wanted his candidate to have political nous, good connections and the ability to command a level of respect among the left-wing of the NSDAP, the clique of the party that provided much of the support that allowed the Hitlerite traitors to be removed.\n\nRöhm quickly found the perfect candidate: Gregor Strasser, the old Gauleiter of Lower Bavaria. Possessing all the qualities necessary to lead the party further to the left and actually give some meaning to the “socialism” in “national socialism”, Strasser was an excellent choice.\n\nThe chief of the SA wasted no time and scheduled a meeting with Strasser, which evidently went over quite well, as Gregor Strasser has just been announced as the new Party Secretary of the NSDAP. This move by the chief has made sense, both politically and practically, but he must remain wary that Strasser doesn’t begin to undermine his power, otherwise everything that he has worked so hard for will collapse around him."
GER_SA.3.A: "A good appointment, however, we shall keep our eyes on him."

GER_SA.4.t: "Night of the Rope"
GER_SA.4.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Chaos continues to descend upon the fragmented German Reich.\nThe SA, once an ally of Adolf Hitler and his associates, has turned on their former Führer.\nEvery morning, the sun reveals pale corpses hung up next to a lamp post. On their necks is a sign, painted with the words \"Schmutz\". Filth.\n\nLast night, the Night of the Rope, frenzied SA paramilitary soldiers started breaking into mansions.\nThe fervour grew until the groups began dragging rich people, reactionaries, and other such scum into the streets, beating them to death.\nThe SA were sure to target and hunt down SS members brutally, slaughtering even their families in the process.\nIt was a disgusting sight for morning workers, frozen bodies rotting in the open. The streets were not cleared until late afternoon. \n\nHeinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich, once prominent members of the Nazi Party, were also eliminated.\nA few witnesses claimed they saw processions of SA radicalists marching out of Himmler's and Heydrich's houses, carrying bright torches in the dark night.\nNeedless to say, they will probably never be heard of again.\n\nLet us just hope that they were shot and didn't suffer a gruesome fate at the hands of those torches..."
GER_SA.4.A: "This blood is a stain on German pride, and one that will be difficult to cleanse."

GER_SA.5.t: "The Diarchy"
GER_SA.5.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Slowly, like dust after a great sandstorm, the great turmoil brought on by the SA Revolution is calming down. But in its place is something much more frightening.\nAn undeclared rivalry has erupted between the two most prominent remaining politicians.\nRöhm and Strasser emerged with newfound power after the revolution, snatching the influence of the old Führer, Adolf Hitler.\nIn the flash of an instant, one of their actions could spark devastating civil war that would plunge Germany into chaos once more.\n\nAs the stability of Germany teeters on a knife edge, Röhm and Strasser secretly examine eachother for weaknesses. Röhm is a violent and disorganized man, known more for his drunken rage than his sly tactics. In fact, Röhm himself had invited his new enemy into the government.\nHe has a loyal following from the lower classes, who, despite being uneducated, are better warriors.\nStrasser is more known for his politics. Currently, Strasser is indeed of less power, but his men are far more organized, some them being in the party itself.\nBut in these dangerous times, loyalty is an unpredictable thing.\nRöhm and Strasser must be cautious not to repeat Hitler's mistake..."
GER_SA.5.A: "How many Germans will be left if this civil war leads to another purge?"


GER_SA.6.t: "Reichstag? More like Ghost-tag"
GER_SA.6.d: "Instability was a mere euphemism to the anarchy of the Weimar Republic. Peace and order were luxuries that even the Almighty Dollar cannot pay, much less the measly Reichsmark. No more than in the Reichstag does this fact hold merit, for no longer was it a sanctuary of debate and parliamentary procedure, but just a brawling arena for the many paramilitaries and thugs who were willing to throw a punch or two, maybe even pump an unlucky legislator full of lead. Healthy Debate as usual in the Republic.\n\nThat is until Röhm's thugs started painting the walls red.\n\nWhat was once the symbol of chaos became the haven of tranquillity. Silence finally prevailed in the Reichstag, yet the stains remain. The walls, the doors, the chairs, the podiums - all soaked with the blood of legislators and others not towing the party line. Some incinerated, others dumped into the Spree River, while the more notable ones received a \"burial\" in Republic Square.\n\nAs the old guard fell to their demise, new faces quickly took their positions. From veteran party officials to Röhm's representatives, they only have one duty - to swing their rubber stamp. No need to voice an objection or question party policy, just approve and payment received. The Reichstag is just a loudspeaker now, filled with shells who sold their soul to the party. The Reaper need not wait for their souls, for it has already arrived at his domain."
GER_SA.6.A: "The Reichstag is truly ruled by ghosts now..."

GER_SA.7.t: "Return to the 25 points"

GER_SA.8.t: "Strasser-Goebbels Doctrine"
GER_SA.8.d: "Today was a busy day for the National Socialist movement. The beloved leader of the NSDAP, George Strasser, accompanied by his loyal associate, Joseph Goebbels, has addressed the population through the radio to discuss new developments related to our doctrine. First, Goebbels thanked Strasser for his fight against \"the corrupt capitalist Jewry that leeches off the nation\" and announced big changes related to our current ideological course. After ranting for few minutes about the dangers of treachery inside the movement, he passed the word to Strasser.\n\nStrasser agreed with the earlier statements made by Goebbels, stating that there were many malicious agents trying to undermine the National Socialist cause. If the economy is on the hands of \"unscrupulous and corrupt people\" instead of the capitalists, then the revolution would have no purpose since they are essentially replacing the tyranny of the Republic for another kind of tyranny. That's why he empathized that a central economy dictated by the party was the best course of action to serve the interests of the German working class. Revitalizing the economy was necessary not only to guarantee the well-being of the people but to repay the injustices of Versailles on the inevitable confrontation against the \"Western reactionary powers.\"\n\nThe speech was a stunning success. The promises of new effective economic reforms were enough to guarantee a great amount of support. Unofficially, some foreign political pundits and even people inside the party are calling these new ideological realignment as the Strasser-Goebbels Doctrine. Some our loyal comrades spying inside the SA reported that Röhm was furious on how well received Strasser's speech, going as far as breaking his own radio on his fury. Röhm and his minions can whine all they want but nothing will stop Germany's path to true National Socialism."
GER_SA.8.A: "For a strong socialist Germany!"

GER_SA.9.t: "Röhm's Power Fades"
GER_SA.9.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]“I will not accept this attack against my authority!” The soldier shouted, crashing his fist onto the table. “Herr Röhm, please calm down. I want to discuss our policy with you and I see no sense in it when you are unreceptive to my ideas.” The secretary countered, trying to keep his own calm and not be affected by the gorilla beating his chest in front of him. “Now if you would excuse me, I wanted to explain how restoring the party's oversight over your men would-” “Its Stabschef Röhm, you insolent paper pusher! I will not accept this pathetic try of a power grab! You are even worse than Hitler, you goddamn scumbag! I should have shot with the others!” “And yet I am here because you know that you are just incompetent to organize anything other than this pathetic horde, that you call an army!” The secretary had risen from his seat and now was ready to fire back. “You know damn well that you need me and I will be happy to assist you, but what I am not ready to do is enable you while you lead this country into Anarchy!”\n\n“Oh, you really think that I need your help? You are wrong, you prick! Get out, go to hell, or whatever! OUT!”\n\n“Herr Stabschef, I am afraid that is not possible.” The Propagandist had so far, being quiet and now moved himself to the Secretary's end of the table. “You see Herr Strasser is a highly competent administrator as well as a dear friend of mine. Seeing him go would greatly jeopardize Germany's future, while also putting a loyal German on the chopping block. I assure you that if you fire Herr Strasser, that I will inform other Germans of your various failures.”\n\nThe content of these words struck the soldier like a sledgehammer. Where mere seconds ago was a livid and self-confident man, now was a scarred wreck of a man, stammering to find an answer. Alas, he would never find it, instead choosing to storm out of the room, but not before smashing a glass on the floor, hoping to at least save a bit of his reputation."
GER_SA.9.A: "This moment of weakness has been observed and noted."

GER_SA.10.t: "Return of Otto Strasser"
GER_SA.10.d: "After being expelled from the NSDAP by the traitorous Hitlerite faction, Otto Strasser formed the Combat League of Revolutionary National Socialists (better known as the Black Front), out of fellow left-wing Nazis who believed that the party leadership at the time had strayed from the original anti-capitalist ideals of the national socialist vision.\n\nNow that the traitorous Hitler has been removed, Otto has made a triumphant return, and in doing so, has merged his band of radical national socialists with the rest of the NSDAP. \n\nNaturally, Party Secretary Gregor Strasser intends to give his brother an important position and has come across two that would suit Otto perfectly. The first choice is Gauleiter of the NSDAP/AO, the foreign organization of the party, and the second is the position of Economics Minister. These are both important positions that will satisfy Otto’s ambitions, and play a part in acquiring a prosperous future for the fatherland."
GER_SA.10.A: "The position of Gauleiter will make the best use of Otto’s talents."
GER_SA.10.B: "As the minister of economics, Otto Strasser will bring great prosperity to Germany!"

GER_SA.11.t: "Storm in the Rhine"
GER_SA.11.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Yesterday, SA paramilitary forces entered the Rhineland en masse, an insulting violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The Rhineland was set a demilitarized zone to ensure Germany will never line their men on the French border again. The SA soldiers, dressed proudly in their sharp grey uniforms, stormed into the Rhineland in columns, singing the German national anthem. French and British diplomats protested loudly about this overt breach of the Versaille treaty. However, their furious cries eventually wound down into weak complaints as the fact remained/:/ The SA is not affiliated with the German military... yet. This shows German intentions of re-armament, the very thing Versaille sought to prevent. Not only that, but it has revealed the soft backbone of the French and British politicians. While France at least moved some divisions to the border, Britain avoided any military actions. It seems the two countries are willing to go to great lengths to prevent another world war. These developments all go in the favour of the Germans, as they gain confidence from the indecisiveness of the two allies. It is unclear what German intentions are, but it is expected that Röhm will attempt to restore Germany's former borders."
GER_SA.11.A: "Germany will no longer bow to worthless treaties."

GER_SA.12.t: "Röhm's Army"
GER_SA.12.d: "The men's laughter boomed across the small tavern, on that usual busy day at Berlin. The annoyed customers couldn't stand the unbearable noise made by the small group, but no one was willing to bother the thugs of the SA on their lunch break. Hans took another sip of his beer to cool his throat and continued with his story. \"So we broke through the door, and the guy started to get angry at us. He spew some shit at us about how he didn't deserve this because he was a veteran and not a Jew or a communist and all that crap.\" The bartender made sure that their jugs remained filled: he still had to replace the windows from last time.\n\n\"Then I grabbed that bastard by the neck and said right to his face: Who told you that you didn't have to be a Jew or a communist to avoid getting beaten, you bourgoise piece of shit?\" exclaimed Hans. Terrified, the business man at the other table nerviously tried to finish his glass of wine. What was stopping these men to doing the same thing to him and his family?\n\nHans then started to point proudly at the Iron Cross on his uniform. \"And that's story of how I got this!\" The group started to laugh even louder to the horror of the other people inside the tavern. No one was safe on the new Germany. \"To be fair, his house was filled with jewelry and fancy French paintings. So he probably had a very high rank. I should have cut his tongue too.\" one of the SA men said with his mouth filled with sausage.\n\nAfter drinking and laughing for twenty minutes, the group got up from their chairs. \"Well, looks the duty is calling. Put it in my account, Max. We'll pay later.\" Hans said to the bartender. While the SA left the tavern, the bartender privately cursed those men that now manage the fate of the entire German nation: \"At least the SS always paid the bill!\""
GER_SA.12.A: "We run the show now!"

GER_SA.13.t: "The Second Wave"
GER_SA.13.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]The Night of the Rope. A night that all people across the German Reich remember with stone-cold fear. That night, the SA thugs were focused on eliminating politial rivals like Heinrich Himmler. In their beds, children could hear the countless screams, the crack of bullets, and then a gut-wrenching silence as everyone prayed to hear the SA marching in the distance, not the dreadful crescendo of boots outside their doors. But gradually, the blood that was shed was allowed to dry.\n\nUntil the streets were coated in red by Death once more.\n\nThe SA was restless due to the recent lack of activity, and at midnight, drunken henchmen prowled the empty streets looking for suspicious civilians to attack. Nobody was outside due to the recent hangings. Robbed of a brawl, the bloodthirsty SA brutes busted into the mansions of industrialists and bankers. Many prominent businessmen were dragged out of their homes and herded into the freezing streets. Stragglers or those who resisted were beaten or shot. Others simply froze of hypothermia.\n\nBy dawn, the chaos had subsided. Victims included Fritz Thyssen, Alfried Krupp, Max Warburg, and Kurt Baron von Schröder. The event was covered up by Röhm, but rumours of a Second Wave of hangings inspired fear in all."
GER_SA.13.A: "How long will the brutes go unpunished?"

GER_SA.14.t: "Röhm's Title"
GER_SA.14.d: "Ernst Röhm currently holds the title of Chief of the Sturmabteilung, and through the organisation’s grip on the nation, is also the leader of Germany. However, these titles are not particularly formal and don’t lend themselves very well to the power and authority that The Brute wields. To rectify this, he will have to make a choice between two different titles, Reichskanzler, or Führer.\n\nThe title of Reichskanzler, or Chancellor, possesses a sense of gravitas and could convey Röhm’s authority effectively. It would be a good choice if it weren’t tainted by the fact that Adolf Hitler, a traitor to Germany and the national socialist vision, once held this position. This could be overlooked, but any association with the traitor, in any manner could spell trouble for the SA Chief’s rule.\n\nThe same is true for the title of Führer, or Leader, which is a shame, since it is such a powerful title, and is absolutely worthy of a man with the power that Röhm holds.\n\nThere is a third choice, however, and that is for Röhm’s title to remain as Chief of the Sturmabteilung. This is certainly the least prestigious of all the choices, but it is the safe choice, as it removes the possibility of any parallels drawn between Röhm and Hitler.\n\nSo, what shall The Brute’s title be?"
GER_SA.14.A: "Gravitas, authority, power, the position of Reichskanzler has it all."
GER_SA.14.B: "Röhm will lead Germany into a prosperous future, it is only fitting that he should be called the Führer."
GER_SA.14.C: "Any association with Hitler could be detrimental to Germany’s future, Röhm shall remain the Chief of the SA."

In the midst of his arrest of our leader, a brave SA patrol managed to stop him before he could take him away, beating the traitor to a bloody pulp before fully apprehending him. All across the country, chaos has ensued as our men have been called to arms, dealing with the small Reichswehr detatchments that would seek to destroy the Second Revolution and Germany along with it. \n The working class have been betrayed too long with the glorified corporal Hitler on top, and his betrayal of our great leader Herr Röhm is the final straw! His corrupt strongman cabinet has been replaced by a hastly assembled cabinet under Röhm consisting entirely of SA members loyal to the Revolution above all else. Even if anarchy rules the streets for now, the revolution shall be triumphant!"

We shall send our best men on a manhunt for his inner clique - namely Minister of Prussia, Herman Göring, who spends more money on luxuries for himself than food for the people, Former Deputy of the Nazi Party and Reichsleiter, Martin Bormann - who spends more time sucking up to the traitor Herr Hitler than anything else, and Deputy Führer Rudolf Hess. With these elements of Hitler's inner clique captured, his faction of the National Socialist party should fall apart like a house of cards, giving the SA complete domination over party and country politics - as it should.

Seeing as he holds military expertise that very few of the SA elite do - and seeing that we cannot trust any Reichswehr generals as Chief of Army, we see it fit to appoint Kurt von Schleicher as chief of army.

A popular and important figure among the Northern enclave of the NSDAP, where the bulk of our political support comes from, he possesses excellent leadership and organisational skills.

As the face of the Sturmabteilung, the sheer amount of blood that was spilled and the brutality caused by the revolution has not reflected too kindly on the now de-facto leader of the country, and he has now been aptly nicknamed “The Brute”.

 GER_Strengthen_the_DAF_desc: "In order to properly include the German workers in our collective efforts it has become a necessity to establish a new form of worker representation in the New National Socialist Germany. This representation will be achieved the reorganization of the German Workers Front (DAF) which previously only served as a puppet organization to appease the workers with hollow promises into a proper National Socialist Union with an elected Workers council and several new rights (as well as duties) in the new state. While some members of the Party and the SA have voiced concerns that this new union could become a hotbed for anti-government agitation, both Röhm and Strasser have assured them that the representatives of the workers will both increase efficiency and trust in the government."

 GER_Bureaucratic_Overtake_of_the_Economy: "Bureaucratic Overtake of the Economy"
 GER_Bureaucratic_Overtake_of_the_Economy_desc: "While the current elites of Germany have proven that they are not to be trusted, their control of the economy should not be underestimated, meaning that any violent attempt to seize their assets could be met with either the destruction or disappearance of said assets.\nIn order to bypass this problem, it has been deemed necessary to peacefully integrate these Junker estates through peaceful means. This will be accomplished through a slow but firm bureaucratic overtake of the economy enforced by several laws and reforms, which will gradually grind down the power of the Junkers, will strengthen the state control over the economy.\nThis process will be continued until the state control is considered sufficient, which will be completed by breaking up the Junker estates and the integration of the now former elites into the regular German society."

 GER_Bury_the_German_Elite: "Bury the German Elite"
 GER_Bury_the_German_Elite_desc: "While there are some in the Party that advocate for a “peaceful and measured“ approach towards the German Upper class in the hopes that they and their economic assets can be “integrated“ into the new German economy, we suffer from no such delusions.\nThe Upper Class has been for decades been a parasite that leeches of the hard work of the workers and peasants, while giving nothing back in return, condemming the common German to unemployment, poverty and despair.\nWe will finally take back what is ours and return the property and wealth of the Junkers back into the hands of the workers."

 GER_State_Run_Corporations: "State Run Corporations"
 GER_State_Run_Corporations_desc: "In the light of our current collectivization efforts it has become apparent that in addition to nationalization of existing companies a widespread establishment of new companies run directly by the state will aid our economy in the transition to a socialist system. These companies will be created through either the founding of new companies using assets from other defunct previously private companies or through the separation of larger companies, monopolies and cartels into a multitude of smaller companies with each of them under the control of appointing, loyal party bureaucrats who will run their companies with the well-being of Germany instead of profit in mind."

 GER_Promote_Reichgenossenschafts: "Promote Reichgenossenschafts"
 GER_Promote_Reichgenossenschafts_desc: "Since the workers are the heart of our movement, it is unacceptable that despite the progress made in the last months, many workers still aren't properly organized and integrated into their respective branches. In order to quickly take care of this we will start a nationwide program promoting the membership in Reichsgenossenschaften, voluntary workers' organizations under the general oversight of the SA, which serve as representatives and enforcers of the workers will.\nThese measures will serve to tie the SA closer into the general economy and the workers' community, while increasing our economies capabilities through the better organization of our nation's workforce."

 GER_Death_of_Capitalist_Organizations: "Death of Capitalist Organizations"
 GER_Death_of_Capitalist_Organizations_desc: "Do you know the greatest fear of Capitalists? It is a united, worker’s population, that is hell-bent on destroying everything they have worked upon, their exploitation of the masses and their unimaginable wealth built by blood and bullets swept away, back into the pockets of the people who worked day and night in their factories. It is this very reason that the Capitalists preach individualism and self-identity because they fear that if we unite as a collective mind, it will spell the end of their autocratic power. It is this very reason, that we must unite all the workers in our state as a single organism. This new organism will tear down the foundations of the Capitalist system, and shall bring about a new age, an age of revolution and a paradise for the worker."

 GER_Reichswerke_Otto_Strasser: "Reichswerke Otto Strasser"
 GER_Reichswerke_Otto_Strasser_desc: "Despite our recent economic reforms our nation still depends on a variety of materials, which so far have to be exported from a multitude of nations. While this currently works fine, it is a possibility that these nations will stop their exports to Germany for unspecified reasons.\nIn order to secure our economic independence, we will find the „Reichswerke Otto Strasser“ a huge conglomerate of state-owned companies that will help us access Germanys resources which so far have been untapped, due to their general inaccessibility and the unwillingness of the capitalist to utilize these „unprofitable“ resources, while also creating a huge number of stable jobs for the German populace."

 GER_Stadt_des_KdfWagens: "Stadt des Kdf-Wagens"
 GER_Stadt_des_KdfWagens_desc: "While the SA was the main force behind the second revolution, we should not forget the workers who are the lifeblood of both Germany and the SA. To give something back to the workers, Ernst Röhm has devised a program that would make a personal car access to the bulk of the German populace.\nDubbed the „KdF-Wagen“, after the suborganization of the DAF, Röhm's plan calls for the establishment of a truly gigantic car factory in the quaint city of Fallersleben, which will produce greater numbers of cars for the general populace, while also reducing unemployment in the area to near zero, with the Fallersleben becoming the official city of the Kdf-Wagen."

 GER_Increase_in_Social_Welfare: "Increase in Social Welfare"
 GER_Increase_in_Social_Welfare_desc: "Since our main motivation is the well-being of the German populace, it is a logical step to improve the often lacking social welfare by greatly increasing the funding for a variety of government programs such as an unemployment fund, a maternity loan, accessible health care and others.\nThese programs will be greatly appreaciated by the workers who previously had to suffer from the fear of unemployment and workplace accident, which could ruin entire families, while the economy will surely be boosted by the new influx of motivated and content workers."

 GER_Turn_the_SA_into_the_Police: "Turn the SA into the Police"
 GER_Turn_the_SA_into_the_Police_desc: "The Hilfspolizei was an auxiliary police force containing branches of the Sturmabteilung and Schutzstaffel formed by Hermann Göring in 1933 to assist the regular police force in destroying communist sympathisers and other enemies in the aftermath of the Reichstag fire. However, it was only active for a month, since Hitler lost faith in the SA, and felt that there was no longer a threat to his regime. But he is no longer in power, we are.\n\nDue to the nature in which we gained power, there are certainly some dissenting influences similar to the ones that Hitler faced, and they pose a threat to our agenda and our plans. To fix these problems, we must follow the approach that brought Hitler success, and revive the Hilfspolizei. This time, it will remain a permanent part of our law enforcement branch, and will continue to protect Herr Röhm’s administration after our initial enemies are defeated."

 GER_Smash_Loot_Burn: "Smash, Loot, Burn!"
 GER_Smash_Loot_Burn_desc: "Smash, Loot, Burn! Now with Germany in our hands and our boys ready for a proper scrapping, it has become time to show all the traitors, Jews and capitalists, that Hitler just had ignored, what living in the new Germany will be like for them! All throughout the country we will give our men a free ticket to “confiscate“ all the property they desire while anyone that doesn't fit into our new Germany will be roughed up and arrested.\nBones will be broken, windows will be smashed, synagouges will be raided and set alight while we,the brave men of Germany, will breath in the ashes and pour a drink for our fallen comrades and on Germanys awaking! And should anyone be stupid enought to stand in our way, we will be sure to give them a good strong noose, made by the brave lads of the SA!"

 GER_Storm_in_the_Rhineland: "Storm in the Rhineland"
 GER_Storm_in_the_Rhineland_desc: "The Rhineland is a crucial part of the fatherland, and not being able to move our own army through it is a great insult. However, the Treaty of Versailles is clear, and we can’t afford to challenge the Western democracies directly right now. There is a loophole though, the Sturmabteilung is not considered to be an official army, so we can technically send the SA into the Rhineland to “restore order”, despite the fact that there are already a few Sturmabteilung units stationed there. This will effectively remilitarise the Rhineland, and the Western democracies won’t be able to do a single thing about it."

 GER_Rohms_Private_Army: "Röhm's Private Army"
 GER_Rohms_Private_Army_desc: "Ernst Röhm has been the Chief of the Sturmabteilung for a long time now, and his radical reforms have increased the force’s effectiveness ten-fold, and now that the Chief is the leader of Germany, aiming to bring prosperity to the working class, and bring an end to capitalism, the Sturmabteilung has also risen in importance and status with him, effectively becoming The Brute’s private army, showing nothing but absolute loyalty and gratitude to him, for bringing them, working class, lesser educated thugs, to a prominent position within this new age for Germany."

 GER_Hangings_in_the_Street: "Hangings in the Street"
 GER_Hangings_in_the_Street_desc: "Even though a large part of the Germanys former elite has already fled the country, there are still thousands of rich pigs that remain. Conspiring together with Jews and foreign powers, they seek to end the revolution and destroy everything we have achieved so far. As proud sons of Germany, we will not let them succeed! Preemptive measures must be taken against these class enemies and it will not be pretty. We will drag them out of their fancy homes, rob them blind of all their possessions and if they are lucky they will end quickly when put a bullet in their face, hang them or stomp them into the curb. The unlucky ones will be left to die on the streets, starved and broken, so that they can understand the plight of the Germans, who they robbed and on whose hard-work they grew rich on. No exceptions will be made, no inch will be given and when we are done Germany will be one step closer towards a better society."

 GER_Reorganize_the_Camps: "Reorganize the Camps"
 GER_Reorganize_the_Camps_desc: "When we were under Hitler’s regime we assisted in the construction of dozens of labor camps for political enemies. These camps must now be reorganized against the political enemies of the revolution, not the political enemies of Hitler. Forced labor is productive, and can even benefit us by producing materials needed for the revolution, but as a system of punishment for subversives, it is flawed. The enemies of the revolution are still able to escape, they are still able to plot the demise of the revolution and the proletariat. This can not be allowed, we must consolidate the camps under new organization. These camps must be made to kill the enemies of the people and the revolution. Holding them in forced labor and bondage costs us and might be the end of the revolution if the inmates get out of hand. A dead inmate can’t start a revolution, so why keep them alive?"

 GER_Rohms_title: "Röhm's Title?"
 GER_Rohms_title_desc: "The revolution has progressed sufficiently, we have dealt with many class enemies and problems along the way. However, we now have a serious question on the minds of many politicians. What is Herr Röhm’s official title? He is the leader of the SA, but is that all? Surely he would want to be something important, like the leader of the party... perhaps even the Führer?\n\nThe Führer title perfectly sums up Röhm’s role in Germany - he is indeed the leader of the revolution and bringer of the future of Germany. All of the oppressed workers and the proletariat look up to him. However, Hitler took the title Führer and the title is now stained with his mere presence. No German citizen can look at the title of Führer and not think of him.\n\nThere is another title Röhm could take: Reichskanzler. The title dates as far back as the Holy Roman Empire, used by German heroes like Otto von Bismarck. Unfortunately, Hitler was also the Reichskanzler once before he took power as Führer. Thus, that title is also stained with his presence. Röhm could take no title, and continue with the current status quo. This ensures that the stain that Hitler's name has left on the revolution no longer remains.\n\nIt is all up to the torchbearer... what shall he be known as?"

 GER_Undermine_the_legal_institutions: "Undermine the "Legel" Institutions"
 GER_Undermine_the_legal_institutions_desc: "We must change Germany for the better, and since the revolution has been a massive success on the military front, we can now focus on more problems at home. The banks, schools, and the markets are not currently in the way Röhm would like them. The schools are not yet teaching the youth, which are the future of Germany about Röhm and National Socialist ideals. The banks are still supporting the regular practices, and the markets are not following the centralized economy that Röhm wants.\n\nTo fix this, we are going to undermine these institutions. The schools will now have children pledge allegiance to Röhm and Germany, and teach our children about the horrors the Class enemies have shoved upon the proletariat. The banks will be closed, and their wealth distributed among the people. The markets will be nationalized and changed to follow Röhm’s plans. Germany will be reformed into Röhm’s Germany, a national socialist country that will last hundreds of years, and it starts with undermining the “legal” institutions."

However, this nation that we see ourselves is nothing more than a backwatered, failed state. Poverty runs rampant amongst our citizens, devouring them of their right to live. Corporate cartels abuse our workers, both foreign and local. They disregard human lives and let them work the harshest conditions, all the while profiting from their labor. No longer, shall this be the identity and destiny of the German people. We shall go on a Palingenesis, a rebirth, of the German nation.

They have suffered too much from the horrors of the Weltkrieg, and are now subservient and incapable of rising once more, as they have been indoctrinated by the West to hate their own birthplace, portraying us as monsters who disregard human lives for our own ambitions. No longer, shall the German people be seen as slaves, as we shall liberate them from their indoctrination and decadent propaganda. A new Germany shall arise from the ashes, one that is deeply nationalistic and a people who are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve global dominance for the Fatherland.

They are bringing prosperity to the country that THEY RESIDE, not the Fatherland. No wonder why our nation is a pariah of Europe, it is because our own citizens flee our nation, willingly used as slave labor to their host nations, from Britain and France to even North America, the land where they call, “The Home of the Free”.

The structures in awe are merely remnants, relics of an old timeline that has brought misery and economic downturn to the masses.
