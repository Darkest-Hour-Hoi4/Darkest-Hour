 EGY_Monarchy.1.t: "Death of King Fuad I"
 EGY_Monarchy.1.d: "His Majesty The King of Egypt and Sudan, Sovereign of Nubia, Kordofan, and Darfur has died of a heart attack in the Koubbeh Palace in Cairo today. A great funeral is being prepared before he will be buried in the Al-Rifa'i Mosque in Cairo.\n\nWhile Fuad I was not a very popular ruler, due to him trying to limit the role of the parliament to advisory status only, frequently dissolving parliament and dismissing cabinets at royal will, he nevertheless was smart and politically astute and successfully guided the Kingdom of Egypt after the United Kingdom ended its protectorate over us. Furthermore, he was an instrumental force in modern Egyptian historiography as he employed numerous archivists to copy, translate and collect old documents from Egyptian archives to create the Royal Archives.\n\nNow, however, it is time to look towards the future and prepare the coronation of his son Farouk I. With Farouk I being only sixteen years old, completely sheltered most of his life and virtually uneducated, many doubt his ability to properly rule over Egypt. It remains to be seen if these doubts come to fruition and what kind of a ruler he will prove to be."
