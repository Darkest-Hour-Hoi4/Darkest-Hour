 Optimisation.1.t: "Optional Setting: Performance Boost"
 Optimisation.1.d: "Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Mod can be somewhat intensive on lower-end computers due to the sheer size and scale of what it adds to the base Hearts of Iron IV experience. Those with lower-end computers (or if you're running a Multiplayer game, slow W-LAN connections) may notice a drop in performance as the game continues. To help remedy this, we have provided an option to help reduce performance impact.\n\nWhat exactly does this do? It will wipe many nations of their industry, army, navy, and inhibit AI function in order to decrease the load on your computer’s CPU. Nations affected are primarily those who had very little direct contribution to the war and largely lack content in the current build. Using this function should benefit your performance, although it may create weird or unintended situations (such as invading a nation only to find that they have no Army to oppose you, nor any factories to seize)."
 Optimisation.1.A: "Yes, I would like to enable this option"
 Optimisation.1.B: "No, I will play without this."
 DH_Optimisation_tt: "§RMany Latin American countries will be disabled, boosting your performance.§!"
