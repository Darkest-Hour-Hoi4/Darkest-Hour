### Eastern Greenland Case
  NOR_Eastern_Greenland_Case.2.t: "Eastern Greenland Case: Ruling for Norway"
  NOR_Eastern_Greenland_Case.2.d: "[FROM.GetNewsIcon]Closing arguments between the kingdoms of Denmark and Norway were heard by the Permanent Court of International Justice regarding the Eastern Greenland Case..\n\nThe case centered around Norway's possessions on the eastern coast of Greenland. Erik the Red's Land (Eirik Raudes Land as it is known in Norway) was proclaimed by the Norwegian royalty to be a Norwegian territory in 1931..\n\nDenmark argues that the entirety of the island is under Danish sovereignty, citing the Ihlen Declaration between the nations as its claim. The Ihlen Declaration, named after former Norwegian foreign minister Nils Claus Ihlen, was a statement made by Ihlen to the Danish minister that Denmark's claims of sovereignty over Greenland would not be opposed by Norway..\n\nHowever, Ihlen was in violation of the Norwegian Constitution by entering into a treaty with a foreign government without consent of Parliament. Norway says this makes the agreement null and void, whereas Denmark says Ihlen's word must be upheld as an agreement between the governments..\n\nAfter much deliberation, the PCIJ has reached its verdict: Ihlen's agreement is non-binding to Norway as he was not unilaterally allowed to enter treaties. Both nations have accepted the ruling, and Denmark has revoked their claims on the Norwegian Greenlandic territories."

Both nations have accepted the ruling and Denmark has already begun integrating the territories."
