 GER_SOV_War.0.t: "Barbarossa Thwarted, New Directives are Required."
 GER_SOV_War.0.d: "The initial stages of Unternehmen Barbarossa resulted in significant advances in Russia, while initially impressive, the advances by the Heer have stalled. And with the frigid winter setting in, the Grenadiers and Panzers have had no choice but to dig in. \n\nThe initially stated objectives have not been met successfully, large bodies of Russian troops have been able to escape encirclement. Along with this, major population and industrial centres are still in enemy hands, and we are still a long way in securing the “A-A Line”.\n\nThis makes the resumption of our advances in the East of almost urgency, for the Bolsheviks cannot be allowed respite to regroup. And accordingly, the OKH has decided to continues our operations as soon as the Summer comes. \n\nBut herein lies our predicament, the frontline units are depleted, supplies are running low, partisans run rampant behind the lines, winter clothing and shelter are lacking, troops stuff their stolen Red Army coats with newspapers to attempt to fight off the cold, but we still endure. After assessing our general situation, simply put- it is logistically and physically impossible to resume the operations on a broad front.\n\nWe can only concentrate our forces in a single particular sector and hope we achieve an overwhelming victory there. And attempt to precipitate a large enough crisis in the Soviet lines, which allows us to eventually fold it and push the Reds out of European Russia. We can either launch an offensive in the North to isolate Russia from foreign aid or smash their lines in the Centre and bifurcate their lines or if we want- we can strike into the Caucasus and pluck the rich pickings of the oil fields in Maikop, Grozny, Baku, etc."

 GER_SOV_War.7.t: "Red Star Rising"
 GER_SOV_War.7.d: "It seems almost an era ago, when the Fascist Scum betrayed all our standing agreements and "friendship" treaties, and began massive incursions all along our border. Within days, the catastrophe was evident, these “incursions” were the spearheads of massive pincers, that encircled large parts of the Red Army. The Luftwaffe grounded the VVS and the Red Navy was bottled up in the major ports.\n\nWe gave ground, but the nation held on, within months the Soviet society was mobilised for war in the most absolute terms. Massive conscription, Tractor factories being retooled to churn out Armoured Legions, Party bosses mobilising cadres to facilitate the war effort, and the likes were commonplace.\n\nDespite this, there were unmitigated disasters in the early days. But for every Division we lost, we learnt, the STAVKA learnt, the Front Commander learnt, the Army Commander learnt, and the Rifleman who escaped..........he also learnt. And most surprisingly, even the dogs learnt, strapped with explosives they did their fare share to teach the fascist scum. The German officers are ageing men, with experience and all no doubt, but the new breed that is emerging from within the rank and file of Red Army is that of young, dynamic and decisive leaders, destined to turn the tide.\n\nAfter such a heavy cost in manpower, land and material we have accumulated unparalleled experience, new raisings receive experience in "quiet sectors" and are blooded and experience to be committed in offensives. Slowly but surely, we have come a long way, our Army is finally standing ground, even pushing the fascists back in some places. Massive Industrial complexes in the Urals churn out endless lines of tanks, planes and guns, their bright furnaces working all day with no rest. It's time to finally take back the fight to the enemy. For it might be a long way to Berlin for us, but even longer for the Fascists to ever reach the Urals."
