 PER_Flavour.1.t: "The Iranian Famine"
 PER_Flavour.1.d: "[PER.GetNewsIcon]Iran, which is currently under Allied occupation, has been struck by a major famine.\n\nSince the occupation, both the British and the Soviets have sought to expand their influence in their respective zones. They subsequently took control of a large number of privately owned vehicles and railways, but without the importation of spare parts, supply systems swiftly broke down. The cost of living rapidly increased by 700%. Famine initially devastated the British south side following a poor harvest. The British-promised grain never arrived, and after turning to the Americas for assistance, diplomat Louis G. Dreyfus, who at first was worried about the famine, urged that America should support "the British stand and insist on Iran assisting itself before relying on Allied imports." Officially, the British blamed the famine on hoarding, ineffective distribution, and an insufficient transportation system, but whispers in Washington claim the famine was purposefully caused. The Soviets haven't helped much either, restricting northern food imports and blaming the British for the famine. While the Soviet Union has supplied 25,000 tonnes of grain so far, it is considered "too little, too late" to stop the famine.\n\nFollowing reports of mounting starvation deaths, the United States dispatched Lieutenant-General Patrick J. Hurley to examine the famine. The famine, which should have been caused by direct warfare or a lack of food supply, is now seen as entirely avoidable and largely caused by low shipments and a "finger pointing" mentality. For the time being, it appears that the Iranian people will have to endure until the next harvest."
 PER_Flavour.1.A: "Our help wasn’t enough?"
 PER_Flavour.1.B: "How is this our fault? The Iranians are the ones hoarding!"
 PER_Flavour.1.C: "A disaster that should have been avoided."
