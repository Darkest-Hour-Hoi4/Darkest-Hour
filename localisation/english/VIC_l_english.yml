 VIC_Politics.1.title: "Submit or Fight!"
 VIC_Politics.1.desc: "This morning German officers have been demanding unconditional cooperation of the French State, in effect starting the occupation of all of France. The Vichy government is meeting to decide on the course of action. Some state that enough is enough and that Germany must abide by the armistice, while others argue that Germany will simply ignore any counter offer and demands total submission from France. Do we fight? Or do we submit?"
 VIC_Politics.1.A: "Submit to Germany."
 VIC_Politics.1.B: "Join Allies" 

 VIC_Politics.2.title: "Beginning of the Riom Trial"
 VIC_Politics.2.desc: "Today marks the beginning of the Riom Trial, an attempt from the governement of the French State to denounce the ways of the Third Republic and their leaders."
 VIC_Politics.2.A: "So it begins..."
 VIC_Politics.3.title: "The Governement of Vichy Makes a Demand"
 VIC_Politics.3.desc: "Today, the Vichy Governement asked us to give them back the tanks that we captured after the fall of France. This will, of course have no impact on our army, as most of those tanks are already outdated and un-used, but what would they do with those extra weapons ? Could they be planning a rebellion against us? What should we do ?"
 VIC_Politics.3.A: "Send Them Back"
 VIC_Politics.3.B: "Don't Even Bother."
 VIC_Politics.4.title: "The Riom Trial Fails"
 VIC_Politics.4.desc: "An important broadcast from the Court arrived today. It announced that the Defendant side won during the Riom Trial. Despite the accusations made by the Authoritarian Governement, the representatives of the Third Republic walked out the Court Room victorious. This is sure to have some kind of impact in the French people's mind, and their loyalty to Pétain and his State is sure to be questionned. "
 VIC_Politics.4.A: "This is a Disaster !"
 VIC_Politics.5.title: "Return to the Earth"
 VIC_Politics.5.desc: "In order to better organise our country and pay the German war reparations, Pétain has announced today that France will be under-going a great reform ; A return to the Earth, which aims at increasing rural populations and lifestyles. Only time will tell if the Nation will be able to withstand such a brutal change of economy, but Pétain seemed rather confident that this is the right move."
 VIC_Politics.5.A: "So be it, start the reform"
 VIC_Politics.5.B: "Reject this idea !"
