# Example on how to make a soundeffect to add in game
#######################################

# First of all make a sound so that the game can find the location of the file
# Then make a soundeffect, in there you can change a bunch of things, to know more visit https://hoi4.paradoxwikis.com/Sound_modding
# Finally add in the event/focus/decision whatever sound_effect = "sound_test_2"
# Remember that the files must be .wav
