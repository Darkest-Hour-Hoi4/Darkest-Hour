 IRQ_Collapsing_Authorities: "Collapsing Authorities"
 IRQ_Collapsing_Authorities_desc: "In an ironic turn of events, attempts to maintain order have only served to further entropy. Actions taken by the Hashemite government have done little to stay the steady hand of turmoil, only serving to prolong the nation’s fading flame. Dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs is commonplace within our borders, appeasement only going so far as to prevent civil war. The Prime Minister folding to the British was only the first nail in our proverbial coffin. Numerous domestic blunders leave almost all distraught with the current course of Iraq. The economy continues to decline and we still owe allegiance to a foreign power. We assumed our days of subjugation were numbered. To have such hopes stripped away seems to be the tipping point for the factions."

 IRQ_Anglo_Iraqi_Treaty: "Anglo Iraqi Treaty" 
 IRQ_Anglo_Iraqi_Treaty_desc: "Built upon the foundations laid in 1922, the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930 was signed under the pretense of discovered oil fields in Mesopotamia. The British have grown greedy in their attempts to maintain such a large fleet, thus their eyes shifted to our bountiful lands once more. The treaty, though an alliance in name, essentially designates Iraq as a collaboration government of the British Crown in 11 articles, thus limiting our autonomy, dictating our trade, and subjecting us to an indefinite British military occupation. According to the arrangement, in the event of war, the Iraqi government must firmly join the British as an ally, offering the entirety of our nation to a cause abroad.\n\nDespite the abhorrently unequal terms of the agreement, the pro-British government of Iraq could not refuse despite rampant protests from the citizenry and moderate government offices. Championed by the Prime Minister and leveraged by foreign influence among several factions, including the army, the Hashemite government hastily signed the unfair treaty. As unrest ensues, the government continues attempts to appease all sides: from foreigners to nationalists, from liberals to covenants, from Shia minorities to the armed forces. However, appeasement can only go so far. Even the Government Bloc, comprised of the King’s most trusted allies, faces internal strife.\n\nAs our freedoms grow further and further restricted, political unrest boils higher and higher. Once thought of as liberators, the Angles have proven themselves no better than the Ottomans."
